# DF Offuture Project
In this group project, we had to find insights using SQL and create visualisations in Tableau. We then presented these insights to a large audience. This was my first time using Tableau in a project.

## Project Description
We were given sales data over a five-year period from a client called 'Offuture'. The requirements of the project were to provide a descriptive analysis of the data in that period and give a presentation on the insights that we found from that analysis. This presentation was done in-person in front of the whole Digital Futures Academy cohort. To prepare for this presentation we first explored the data in SQL to find insights and get an understanding of the data (_Offuture Project SQL Code.sql_). Then we used Tableau to show these insights in a way that could be presented clearly.

My part of the presentation looks into the distribution of sales and profits for items sold with a discount. For example, Offuture made an overall profit on all types of products except for tables where they made a significant loss. After exploring the data I found out that Offuture had more often than not gave large discounts when selling tables which seemed to be the main reason why losses were made. I presented these findings using the graphs in two Tableau dashboards.
